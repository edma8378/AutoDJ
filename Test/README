BASIC TEST RUN:  
	RUN SERVER:   $ webdriver-manager start
	RUN TESTS:    $ protractor conf.js

python module problems
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/my/other/path

If that doesn't work keep reading

Dependencies:
	 node.js          
	java jdk
	webdriver/selenium   OR chromedriver  (*EDIT*) no don't
Guide: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial  <<if you have any issues

Install Protractor
	$ npm install -g protractor

To get the webdriver/selenium test server:
	$ sudo npm-install selenium-webdriver
	$ sudo webdriver-manager update --standalone
	Guide: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial

To run the combo:
	1.) Start server   leave it running
	$ webdriver-manager start  
	2.) View session in browser, not really sure why, 
		but to know it's working maybe http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/   
		(This is the default selenium gives you I think, if it
		 doesn't work check the protractor_conf.js file and look
		 at the selenium address, match that to your filesystem's
		 selenium path address n junk.)
	3.) Run the written tests  do it do it do it
	$ protractor conf.js

	>This should open another browser directing to your local server's version 
	of the app. It 	should pop up, maybe not even load all the way cause its
	 supafast, and close. The command line will spit out the results, the one
	 assertion should pass in green.
	 NOTE: If your address is not 'localhost' this will not work, go into 
	protractor_conf.js and 	protractor_test.js and change the baseURL and 
	browser.get()  respectively. Guide: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial

-----Leave this bullshit below here in case Alex or Mitchell can't use the selenium server or something and need to make chromedriver bullshit to work.-----
To install chromedriver: 

Prereqs: have chrome in /usr/bin/google-chrome
	guide: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver

Download and install: 
	https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
	executable is in the zip file

To run the tests with chromedriver:
	$ protractor protractor_conf.js



ARCHITECTURE     (if you care, or wish to question your test lord)
 	http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/testing-angularjs-apps-protractor
	Conclusion:  use combo of seleniumdriver and webdriver
	No longer supporting chromedriver because I can't get the path to recognize it unles it's 	in node_modules in your app directly and that's fucking bullshit fuck that.

in the end you need to be running the server, and have a conf.js and spec.js
