#THIS IS TEMPORARY#

The backend and tools scripts are wrtiten in python 2.7 which is standard on any linux distribition.
The only dependency for the moment is eyed3 which is included in the dependencies folder.

cd dependencies/
tar xvzf eyed3-<version>.tgz
cd eyed3-<version>/
python setup.py install

If this installs with no errors, go back to the dependencies folder and delete the eyed3-<version>
folder.

After that, your done. You can now run the database tools to create the local sqlite database.


Kristi: For most recent NodeJs, (version 10.33) do this. 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties python g++ make
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
Now nodejs --version and SEE IT
For npm, now do 
npm install 
and we will probably need bower later
sudo npm install -g bower

maybe protractor for webpage testing
npm install -g protractor
bower install
